**bamazonCustomer.js** - This is the customer-facing application that allows a customer to buy a product.  It lists the available products and prompts the customer to choose a product and the quantity of that product to buy.  Then, it checks to make sure there is enough quantity in stock, and if so, completes the purchase and tallies the cost to the customer.
